Regression Analysis: CASE STUDY: WHAT FACTORS AFFECT THE CGPA OF STUDENTS AT UTSC


At the University of Toronto Scarborough campus, students are evaluated on their academic
achievements by determining their Cumulative Grade Point Average or commonly abbreviated as
CGPA. The CGPA is a number that is used as an assessment tool to evaluate a student’s academic
performance. This is the most common way for educational institutions to map their students and
provide information on how to maximize their skills. In high school, the purpose of a CGPA is to
help navigate a student towards their interests and guide them into renowned higher educational
institutions.
Although, this is not the case in every institution. Some also follow the highly popular Alphabet
Grading Scheme that ranges from A to F which can be further broken down into + and -. The
Alphabet Grading Scheme is not the focus of this paper but is a scheme that must be acknowledged
due to its popularity.
At the undergraduate level, a student’s CGPA defines the students time at the university. With
students being given adult like freedom, a student’s CGPA allows hiring representatives at firms
and recruitment staffs at honorable master’s programs to understand what type of student they are
recruiting. The higher a student’s CGPA, the better their chances are at getting a good job or their
desired master’s program. However, it might be easy to pinpoint the best student, but the purpose
of this study will be to find out which socio-economic and demographic factors have an impact on
students’ CGPA.
